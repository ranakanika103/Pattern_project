# 🎨 Pattern Project in Python (Jupyter Notebook)


Welcome to the **Pattern Project**, a beginner-to-intermediate level project built in **Python using Jupyter Notebook**.  
This project focuses on generating different **mathematical and visual patterns** using loops, conditionals, and creative logic.


---


## 📖 Introduction


Patterns are one of the most exciting ways to strengthen programming fundamentals.  
In this project, I created various **star, number, and character-based patterns** with Python.  

It not only improves problem-solving and logical thinking but also helps in mastering **loops, nested loops, and conditional statements**.
